# Commits / Pull Requests

ABSOLUTELY NO MALWARE should be pushed to the repository. If it is a direct push, the commit will be reverted, and you will be denied access to the repo.

## HexxiumCreations Members

Those making commits from HexxiumCreations, PLEASE create a new branch, then create a pull request. Your request will be reviewed by Joe, and then will be approved/closed. Please don't commit directly without permission, or your commit will be reverted. I've already told my dev group this, but DO NOT APPROVE PULL REQUESTS WITHOUT MY PERMISSION (Doing so will result in a loss of access for this repository)
